      <description>I’ve been following the news about istio since it’s first alpha release in 2017. I think this project has a great future, because it solves a lot of pain points in the microservice based architecture, like auth, observability, fault-injection, etc.
But the fact is, I never actually tried it. Prior to v1.0 there were too many bugs and limitations to put it into production. So, when they finally released “production-ready” version I got quite exciting.</description>
